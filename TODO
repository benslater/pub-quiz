  - Image rounds, music rounds
  - Reconnect to game in progress
  - Dockerise and redeploy with different host
    - Will need replacement for heroku-provided things:
      - Papertrail
      - RedisToGo
      - Heroku scheduler
  - Task/Heroku Scheduler to clean db. Every midnight, remove games that are > 24h old
  - Navigating to routes from initial page hit (e.g. hitting /setup server-side)
  - Use layouts in svelte router to make a reusable header-main-footer style
  - DX. Make dev and prod match. Fix CORS, fix CSRF.
  - Better layout of game screen for host - particularly how incoming answers layout.
  - Honestly probably rewrite in React and Django/Rails or something.
